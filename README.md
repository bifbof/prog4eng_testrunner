Small Matlab test runner that tests functions of students.

Is quite minimal and everything should be well described in the file `test.m`.

A test can:

- _pass_, everything works as intended (correct output or expected error)
- _fail_, does not succeed (wrong output or did not raise an error)
- _error_, raises an unexpected error
- _timeout_, takes longer than expected

The following *constants* can be modified
- `TIMEOUT_TRESH`, time until test times out
- `ABS_TOL`, absolute tolerance when comparing numbers
- `REL_TOL`, relative tolerance when comparing numbers

For comparing numbers the code was adapted from [this function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose) &rarr;Â see there for an explanation for `ABS_TOL`, `REL_TOL`.

For adding new test cases, pass an anonymous function to `test_function` with the expected return value of the function. Again see `test.m` for examples.

See below a test run, with a function of an exercise from 2023.
